🧬 H1N1 Vaccination Prediction
This project aims to predict whether individuals are likely to receive the H1N1 flu vaccine based on behavioral, demographic, and health-related features. Using a dataset sourced from a public health survey, the notebook walks through:
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations
🧹 Data preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
🤖 Model building using Logistic Regression to classify vaccination likelihood
📈 Evaluation using classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
This model can help public health officials identify groups with low vaccination uptake and tailor awareness campaigns accordingly.

🚕 Taxi Fare Prediction
This regression project predicts taxi fare amounts based on trip details such as pickup/dropoff coordinates, time, and passenger count. The notebook includes:
🗺️ Geospatial feature engineering using pickup and dropoff locations
🧼 Data cleaning and visualization to detect anomalies and trends
🧮 Model training using Linear Regression to estimate fare prices
📉 Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world pricing problems in transportation and logistics.
